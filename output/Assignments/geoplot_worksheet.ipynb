    "> At the end of this exercise, you will know how to add data points (x/y pairs) to a map.  This is a way to graph the position of GPS points collected using your smartphone or other GPS device. The module Cartopy extends the basic capabilities of Matplotlib for making geographic maps.  It is easy to use and builds maps rapidly with a few short commands.  More complicated tasks are also possible, including adding topography, bathymetry or contouring other info on top of a map.  This can be image data, NASA satellite data, earthquake data - the possibilities are many.\n"
