    "### Good names for files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    " Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful\n",
    " when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful\n",
    " tips for the names of your files.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Don't use whitespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Whitespaces can make a name more meaningful\n",
    "   but since whitespace is used to break arguments on the command line\n",
    "   is better to avoid them on name of files and directories.\n",
    "    You can use `-` or `_` instead of whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Don't begin the name with `-` (dash).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Commands treat names starting with `-` as options.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Stick with letters, numbers, `.` (period), `-` (dash) and `_` (underscore).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many other characters have special meanings on the command line, and might confuse your operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have whitespace\n",
    " or another non-alphanumeric character, you should surround the name in quotes (`\"\"`).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Which Editor?\n",
    "\n",
    " When we say, \"`nano` is a text editor,\" we really do mean \"text\": it can\n",
    " only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other\n",
    " human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the\n",
    " least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may\n",
    " not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do\n",
    " after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X),\n",
    " many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or\n",
    " [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn),\n",
    " or a graphical editor such as\n",
    " [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to\n",
    " use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in\n",
    " editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same\n",
