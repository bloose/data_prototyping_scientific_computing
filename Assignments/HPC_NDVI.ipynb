    "Use the documentation to supplement this guide https://docs.unity.uri.edu/documentation/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to request a parallel processor 'job'and set up a Python environment that will use that job.\n",
    "2. Write a short function to test and confirm that parallel processing is taking place.\n",
    "3. Use these concepts to modify landsatexplore.py from Week09 and implement the NDVI calculation.\n",
    "1. Use the Unity cluster to split this calculation amongst the processors and peform the computation for all the satellite images in your items list.\n",
    "1. Observe whether there is a seasonal difference in the NDVI for the RI/New England region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This exercise uses cumulative concepts from throughout the course, including use of list and numpy arrays, creation of modules, reading and writing files, using Pandas dataframes, and unix commands. Refer to your code from previous weeks and to the online library documentation as needed."

    "\n",
    "The [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) can be computed directly from two frequency bands in the Landsat satellite data - the Near Infrared band (NIR) and the visible red (Red) spectral reflectance:\n",

    "$$ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The .tif files ending in _B4.tif contain the near-infrared (NIR) spectral wavelengths, and the .tif files ending in _B3.tif contain the Red spectral reflectance.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Delete, or comment out all usage of graphing and cartopy from Week09. This script will do the NDVI computation using the cluster job and save the results in a Pandas dataframe, nothing more.\n",
    "2. **Put all the code of the script inside the `if` statement below.** This ensures that the cluster resource request will be compiled at runtime before the computations begin:\n",
    "~~~\n",

    "Don't forget to indent\n",
    "3. Add the codeblock from coreclock.py that requests and uses the requested Cluster resources.\n",
    "1. Create a list of scenes (filenames) from the files ending in _B4.tif. This can be found in the text file called test.out, in the same folder `/work/pi_csc593_uri_edu/Landsat`.\n",
    "4. Define a module to compute the NDVI with the following operations.  Your module should take a single element of the list of satellite filenames or `scenes` and it should return the average NDVI value from that item.\n",

    "\n",
    "9. Save the Pandas dataframe for download. I recommend using df.to_pickle('file.pkl'), but you can also use df.to_csv('file.csv');  Depending on which you choose, you then you can read the file with df = pd.read_pickle() or df = read_csv();  \n",
