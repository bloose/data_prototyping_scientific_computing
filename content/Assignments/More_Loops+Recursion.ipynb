    "1. For loops complete a set of repeat instructions by stepping through a list of elements in sequential order. This is often either the elements in a list, tuple or numpy array data type.  A for loop can also be set up to step through an index, where the index steps through array elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While loops complete a set of repeat instructions until a condition is met, based on a conditional operator like (>, <, or ==).  While loops can be useful when you need to keep iterating for an unspecified number of times, until an outcome is achieved.  This is helpful when it is not easy to know how many times will be required to complete the loop.\n",

    "1. The last kind of loop is a unique programming concept called recursion.  This loop takes the operation or algorithm and breaks it into a set of smaller, nested, and sometimes simpler operations.  This is accomplished by allowing the function to call itself until a condition is met.\n"
